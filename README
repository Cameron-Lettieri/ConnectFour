CONNECT FOUR GAME

This is a simple Connect Four game in C++, using the ncurses library to display the game board and colors.


How to Play:
The game is played on a 7x6 board. The two players take turns placing their symbol (O or X) into a column of the board. The symbol will drop to the bottom-most empty slot in that column. The symbol is placed pressing the numbers 1-7 on your keyboard. Once the game is over you can return to the start menu by pressing any button. When you are at the start menu, you can close the program

The first player to connect four of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.


Features:
Play against another human player
Play against an AI opponent
When starting the program, you can choose to play against another human player or against the AI. The AI opponent is a simple implementation that chooses a random column to play in.
